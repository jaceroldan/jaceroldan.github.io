# Summary

Iâ€™ve always been restless with the status quo of learning. From classrooms to codebases, Iâ€™ve looked for ways to go deeper â€” to build, to understand, and to lead.

Today, Iâ€™m an AI Engineering leader with a Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence, leading a team of researchers and engineers focused on solving problems at the intersection of software systems and intelligent behavior.

My background spans over 6 years of full-stack software development (Python, JavaScript, PHP, Django, VueJS), machine learning instruction at the University of the Philippines, and technical leadership across multicultural teams. But what drives me now is research and engineering in:

* ðŸ’¡ Foundation Models (multi-modal, generative systems)
* ðŸ’¡ Natural Language Processing (understanding, reasoning, alignment)
* ðŸ’¡ Embodied AI (agents acting in virtual and physical environments)


I actively prototype, experiment, and publish, pushing the boundaries of how AI systems can perceive, reason, and act. I'm especially excited by open-source, research collaborations, and applications that bring intelligent systems closer to real-world use.

If you're building something ambitious in AI or research-driven tech, Iâ€™d love to connect. Letâ€™s create what comes next.
